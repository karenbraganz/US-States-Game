# US-States-Game
<h4>Do you think you could name all 50 US states? </h4>
<p>In this game, you will be challenged to guess the names of all 50 US states with only a blank US state map for reference. If you guess right, you will see the state's name appear at the correct position on the map. If you guess wrong, you can keep trying until you get them all right. You could also quit the game and review the list of states you weren't able to guess before trying again.</p>
